## üîå ESP32 Serial Communication Setup

This project **communicates with the ESP32 via serial port**:

- In `main.py`, locate and update the following line with your actual port:
  ```python
  ser = serial.Serial('COM18', 115200)  # Replace COM18 with your correct COM port

* You can find your COM port:

  * Windows: Check **Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)**
  * Linux: Usually `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyS#`
  * Mac: `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` or similar

### üß© Mandatory Driver ‚Äì CP210x

Most ESP32 boards use the **CP2102 USB-to-Serial chip**. You **must install the driver**:

üëâ [Download CP210x Driver (Silicon Labs)](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

---

## üíª Software Dependencies
### üîê Picovoice AccessKey Required
To use wake word detection (Porcupine), you must create a **free account** at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) and generate your own **AccessKey**.

### Install all Python packages in one step using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Absolutely! Here's an updated section of the `README.md` that includes a **clear instruction to upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP32**, along with all previous setup info.

### üîå ESP32 Serial Communication Setup

This project **communicates with an ESP32 board via a serial connection** and requires uploading a specific program to the ESP32.

#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step ESP32 Setup

1. **Install the CP210x USB Driver**
   Most ESP32 boards use a CP2102 USB-to-Serial chip. You **must install the driver** for your board to show up as a COM port:
   * üëâ [CP210x USB-to-UART Bridge VCP Drivers ‚Äì Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

2. **Open the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO**

   * Install **ESP32 board support** via the Board Manager (search: `esp32`)
   * Select the appropriate **board** and **COM port**

3. **Upload the Provided ESP32 Code**

   * Open the file `esp32_code.ino` (or the provided Arduino `.ino` file)
   * Click **Upload** to flash it to your ESP32
   * Ensure that the **baud rate** in the Arduino code matches this line in `main.py`:

     ```python
     ser = serial.Serial('COM18', 115200)  # Change COM18 to your actual COM port
     ```
